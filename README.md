Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    is the process of designing,building,testing and maintaining software applications.
       it helps in developing reliable software
       it ensures software is build with security measures to protect against cyber threats
       enables creation of advanced technologies in AI
       


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   
   1950-1960:early programming and structured programming-initial software  development lacked formal methodologies,leading to the 
   development of structured programming to improve coding readability and maintainability

   1970-1980:software engineering as a discipline-the term "software engineering" was introduced to address the "software 
   crisis."leading to systemic methodologies like waterfall model

   1990s-present-Agile and DevOps Revolution-Agile methodologies,DevOps and modern software practices emerged, emphasizing interactive 
   development,collaboration and automation


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1.Requirement analysis-Gather and define project requirements.
   2.planning-outline the project scope,budget and timeline
   3.Design-create system architecture and UI/UX designs
   4.implementation(coding)-Develop the software based on design specifications
   5.Testing-identify and fix defects using different testing strategies.
   6.Deployment-release the software to users
   7.Maintainance-update and fix issues post-release


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  approach- waterfall has linear,sequencial phases while agile has interactive flexible approach.
  changes-waterfall is dificult to implement while agile encourages continuous changes
  Testing- in waterfall is done after implemention while in agile is in continuous testing 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  software developer-writes ,test and maintain codes.
  Quality assurance engineer-ensure software quality through testing
  project manager-oversee project timelines,budget, and team coordination


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs(eg VS code PyCharm)-Provide tools for efficient coding,debugging and testing
VCS(eg Git,Github)-Enables collaboration,version tracking and rollback of changes


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  bugg fixing and debbuging-use systemic testing and debugging tools
  time management-adopt agile methodologies for better flexibillity
  keep up with new technologies-continuous learning through course and documentation


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing-tests individual components for functionality
  intergration testing- ensures modules work together
  system testing-test the entire system for compliance with reqirements
  acceptance testing-validate the software meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  the practise of designing effective input prompts to optimize responses from AI models.it involves crafting precise,structured and 
  contexual promps to improve the acuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs.

  importance-1.enhance responce accuracy-well-crafted prompts leads to more relevant and usefull AI genrated responses
             2.improve efficiency-saves time by reducing the need for multiple refinements.
             3.control ai behaviour-guides the ai to generate responce in a specific format
             4.optimizes AI performance-ensures better utilization of AI capabilities across different applications


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   vagues prompts:
     "tell me about history"

    improved prompt:
      " provide a summmary of world war II,including its causes,major events, and impact on global politics.

      why the prompt is more effective 

       clearer scope-specifies the exact historical topic
       more specific- focuses on world war II rather than general history
       concise yet imformative-include key aspects(causes,major events, and impact) to guide the ai responce
